# Classroom Scheduling Application

## Overview
The Classroom Scheduling Application is a practical solution for managing classroom reservations and usage schedules in educational institutions. The main goal of this project is to simplify the process of reserving classrooms, reduce scheduling conflicts, and ensure transparency and efficiency in space utilization.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Database**: MySQL

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Users (professors, students, administrative staff) can log in through a simple interface. The authentication system ensures that only authorized users can make reservations.
- **Availability Overview**: An interactive calendar allows users to view classroom availability in real-time.
- **Booking Appointments**: Users can reserve classrooms for specific time slots.
- **Administrative Management**: Administrators have special access to review and manage reservations.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: <br>
   ```bash <br>
   git clone https://github.com/MilosPetrovic-programmer/Eduscheduler.git 
2. Navigate to the project directory: <br>
   cd your-repo-name <br>
3. Install the necessary packages for the frontend: <br>
  cd frontend <br>
  npm install <br>
4. Set up the backend: <br>
  Ensure you have PHP and a web server (e.g., XAMPP, MAMP) installed. <br>
  Import the SQL database structure from the database folder. <br>
5. Start the development servers: <br>
  For the frontend, run: <br>
  npm start <br>
  For the backend, start your PHP server. <br>
6. Usage <br>
  Access the application through your web browser at http://localhost:3000 (for the React frontend). <br>
  Log in with your credentials to access classroom availability and reservation features.
<br> <br>
## Challenges
<br>
During the development process, I faced several challenges, including:
<br>
Enabling communication between different ports (frontend on port 3000 and backend on port 80). <br>
Implementing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies for smooth interaction between the client and server.
<br> <br>
## Conclusion
<br>
This project provided valuable experience in web application development, including working with React and PHP. It helped enhance my skills in managing application state, interacting with backend services, and creating user-friendly interfaces.
